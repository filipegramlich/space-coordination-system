# Space Coordination System
## SCS is:

1 - An advanced imperial platform designed to manage and optimize the docking, loading, and unloading operations of spacecraft at Stellar Base Atlas. It ensures efficient allocation of bays, monitors spacecraft status, and coordinates logistics for safe and continuous operations.

2 - A project developed for practice and learning in Python, aimed at developing systems.

At Stellar Base Atlas, due to the high flow of military and commercial spacecraft, the SCS was created to efficiently manage all operations and maintain necessary order.
